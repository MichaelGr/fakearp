Hi, fakeARP is a driver, written as a tutorial on developing Linux network drivers.

It is not connected to any hardware, it doesn't have a cable that connects it to outside world. But it pretends that it does and creates ARP responses when some ARP requests pass through, as if there are other network interfaces on the other side of the cable.

I wrote it to learn about writing network drivers but as it turns out there is not so much info on the internet about that. I was reading Linux Device Drivers - Third Edition which I downloaded from LWN.net and realized that a lot has changed in network subsystem of Linux. I think it will be valuable for anyone who read the book (or other stuff out-dated as far as the network subsystem goes) and wants to catch up with current network code.

The comments inside the code should be enough for anyone who developed drivers before but I will be writing a more detailed tutorial on the code. I will add a link to that as soon as I write it. 

Since the code is meant to be a tutorial it is quite poor when it comes to features. Its flaws are described in the beginning of the code. Also I didn't introduce anything related to rtnl/netlink, anyone curious about that subject can look at bridge driver code inside Linux source and brctl utility.

Under any circumstances it should not be run on a production system. I am a newbie at developing kernel code and this is the very first network driver code I have ever written. As a side note please send me any bugs you encounter.

Hope it helps anyone trying to learn about network drivers,
